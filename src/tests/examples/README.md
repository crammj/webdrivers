# Brief

This is a collection of simple Jest tests that demonstrate some core functionalities of the Jest framework. These tests cover basic concepts such as assertions, testing asynchronous code, mocking functions, and testing for errors.

# Tests

## Basic Assertion Tests (example.basics.test.ts)
These tests demonstrate basic assertions like equality, truthiness, and array membership.

Basic Assertions: Showcase common assertion methods (toBe, toEqual, toContain, etc.).


## Testing Asynchronous Code (example.async.test.ts)
These tests showcase how to handle asynchronous code using async/await and done callbacks.

Async Tests: Demonstrate how to test asynchronous code with async/await, Promises, and done callbacks.


## Testing for Errors (example.errors.test.ts)
These tests demonstrate how to test for exceptions and errors.

Error Testing: Show how to test functions that throw errors.


## Mocking Functions (example.mocking.test.ts)
These tests show how to mock functions and verify that they are called with the correct arguments.

Mocking: Illustrate how to mock functions and check their calls.


## Snapshot Testing (example.snapshot.test.ts)

Snapshot testing is a way to test the output of a function and ensure it doesn't change unexpectedly.

Snapshot Testing: Show how to use snapshot testing.


## Setup and Teardown (example.setup-teardown.test.ts)
These tests demonstrate how to use setup and teardown methods in Jest.

Setup and Teardown: Use beforeEach and afterEach for setup and cleanup between tests.
